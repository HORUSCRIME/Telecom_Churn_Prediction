# Telecom_Churn_Prediction

This project analyzes telecommunication customer data to predict churn and segment customers. It features robust data cleaning, including handling missing values, converting string columns like 'TotalCharges', 'gender', 'InternetService', 'Contract', and 'PaymentMethod' to numerical representations using specific mappings and general label encoding to prevent conversion errors. The script performs exploratory data analysis, visualizes key insights, and builds machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) with a preprocessing pipeline, evaluating them using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC AUC, and cross-validation. It also includes model explainability using Permutation Importance to identify crucial churn drivers. Finally, it segments customers based on their churn probability and engagement metrics, characterizing 'At Risk', 'Loyal', 'New & Potentially Loyal', 'Low Value Loyal', and 'Stable' groups, and provides conceptual recommendations for targeted retention strategies. The script requires pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, and eli5 (optionally shap), expecting a Telecom_Churn_Prediction.csv file in the same directory, and outputs detailed console logs, various plots, and explainability insights.
